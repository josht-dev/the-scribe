## Description

A multi-page application targeted towards individuals who would host tabletop games. A user can create stories, characters, side quests, or plots to share with other users on the app. This app was motivated by two of the main contributors being Game Masters throughout the duration of their lives. They wanted a social media style application where other GMs could easily share ideas and garner inspiration, with the ability to increase the depths of their in-game universes.
